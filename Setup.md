# How to Set Up:
## Setting up Discord Stuff
1. Open config.py and make sure it's writeable. That will handle the Discord Configurations

2. Go to this link [https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/] and add a bot. To get your Token go to the Bot Page and add a bot. The Token should be at the top of the page, click Copy near the Username. Client ID is found on the General Information page, at the top, under the name.

3. To get your bots invite link go here https://discordapi.com/permissions.html

4. Get the client ID from the Discord Config file, and enter it into the Client ID field. Select what permissions you want (For this bot, Read and Send messages are the two you'll need.)

2) run bot.py. On windows the command is something like: C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python36\python.exe "C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\GitHub\Discord-GoogleSheets-bot\bot.py"
3) Add a role to your discord channel for the bot and make sure it has enough privledges to run your script.
